Qwotable has been an incredible journey for me since its creation. It has been my creative sandbox, a space to experiment, learn, and grow as a developer.

But now, I feel it’s time to share a moment of truth: my focus has shifted away from Qwotable, at least for the time being.

Let me clarify: **I’m not abandoning this project. However, it’s no longer my top priority**. I will continue improving the code, refining features, and exploring new ideas, but progress will take a bit longer than before.

If there’s one thing I know about myself, it’s that my passion tends to ebb and flow. This shift of focus may not be permanent, and I might return to Qwotable with renewed energy sooner than expected. Right now, though, my attention is drawn to other pursuits, and I find myself with far less free time than when I started developing this app.

That said, I want to take this opportunity to share some of the plans I have in mind for Qwotable’s future:

* Design improvements for Qwotable’s home screen widget
* Customizable API sources for the random quotes card
* Customizable sources for the home screen widget
* Tagging and filtering options for user-added quotes
* The ability to favorite API quotes and store them offline
* Adding quotes from DWYL


I hope you’ll understand my decision. This is just a pause, not a farewell.

See you soon,

Lijucay
