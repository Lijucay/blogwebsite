Today I want to share some important news with you: **the development of Qwotable has officially come to an end.**

Qwotable has been a very special project for me. It was not only my very first Android app, but also my first step into
sharing my work with the public. Over the years, it grew alongside me. Every new piece of knowledge I gained about
Android development eventually found its way into Qwotable in one form or another.

However, as many developers know, first projects often come with growing pains. While building Qwotable, I sometimes
chose quick solutions over sustainable ones. At the time, they worked well enough, but in the long run, they made the
app's codebase fragile and difficult to maintain. Today, the code has reached a state where continuing development on
top of it would no longer be practical. A complete rewrite would be required, but unfortunately, that would also risk,
that you as users might lose your data, which is something I don't want to happen.

After much thought, I have decided to take a different path: **Qwotable will receive one final update, and a brand-new
app will be released to take its place.**

Here is what it means for you as a user:
- You will be able to keep using Qwotable for at least another year after the release of the new app. After that, the
library will no longer be available and users, that install the app after that time will not be able to use Qwotable
- The final update will give you the chance to migrate your own saved quotes to the new app. I am also exploring the
possibility of migrating your favorites, though I can't guarantee this feature yet.
- A new app will be built from the ground up with the lessons I learned from Qwotable. The code should be cleaner, more
future-proof, and designed to evolve.

I know this transition may cause some inconvenience, and I truly apologize for that. But I also want to say **thank 
you**, to everyone who downloaded Qwotable, added their own quotes, marked their favorites, or simply enjoyed opening
the app once in a while. Your support has meant the world to me and kept me motivated through every stage of its
development.

While Qwotable's journey is ending, a new one is just beginning. I am excited to share more about the next app soon, and
I hope you'll join me there as well.

**See you in the next update!**
